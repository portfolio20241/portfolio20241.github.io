A 3D reconstruction of a textured plane has been carried out. In different sets, the plane was either still or moving either vertically, horizontally, or away with respect to the camera. Given the source images and resulting pointcloud data, the task was to evaluate the accuracy of the reconstruction.

We have applied FAST Corner detection to detect and features of the texture on the plane, letting us track its motion over time. A rectangular region of interest was selected for each dataset using the observed displacement of the features to move together with the plane. The Root Mean Square error was computed in this region to detect the reconstruction accuracy, averaged over time. The resulting error was visualized as a colored plot.
