# Introduction
Ever since I did AI Class 2011 back in high school, I wanted to implement SLAM. I even tried to make a Lego NXT robot map the environment using a single ultrasonic sensor back then. I have approached this goal, but sadly, did not succeed, during my honours project. This is my next attempt.

A secondary goal is to learn how to use Bundle Optimizers. I want to figure out how much it improves the trajectory, or if it can't work without one at all. For now, I'm using `g2o`.

I want to make a car build a map and localise itself using either monocular or binocular vision. For this, I'm attempting to use ORB features and descriptors, triangulate 3D points and poses, then use `g2o` to refine the locations, and finally, plot everything in 3D.

Currently I have the plotting `g2o` and (`pangolin`) ready, but cannot test it, because of issues with 3D point triangulation.
I hope to find the time to work on this project more in the near future.

Disclaimer: This is heavily inspired by [George Hotz's Live SLAM coding session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hlb8YX2-W8). I am using his code and thinking as reference.
